Raycasting is a computer graphics technique used to determine what objects are visible in a 3D scene from a specific viewpoint. In simple terms, imagine you're standing in a room and you want to "see" the objects in the room. To do this, you cast out imaginary rays (like beams of light) from your eyes in different directions. When these rays hit an object, you know that the object is visible from your viewpoint.

In computer graphics, raycasting is often used for rendering 3D scenes, collision detection, and other tasks that involve figuring out what objects are visible or can be interacted with. The process is repeated for each pixel on the screen to create the final image.
